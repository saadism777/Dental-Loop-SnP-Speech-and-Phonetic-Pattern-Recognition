 The application 'face_app.py' incorporates the Dlib library, which is based on C++, and leverages deep neural networks for facial landmark recognition [2]. Within the current software, Dlib's face detection method, employing histogram-oriented techniques (HOG), has been adapted to identify facial landmarks and contours through the use of the pretrained model 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat' [3]. To accomplish face detection, a custom algorithm was developed utilizing Dlib's 'get_frontal_face_detector()' method, enabling the identification and retrieval of faces from images or frames. Notably, an additional memory feature was implemented to enhance reliability and maintain focus on a single face within each frame during a recording session. This enhanced algorithm detects and retains the initial identified face alongside its associated landmarks. The process commences with loading the essential face detectors and landmark detection models. Then, a while loop iteratively extracts frames from the video and converts them into grayscale images. The loaded detectors analyze the grayscale image to recognize and visually represent faces and landmarks within an OpenCV window. This iterative procedure persists until either all frames are processed or the application is manually terminated.
As per the requirements of this research study, a novel landmark referred to as the sN (soft tissue over nasion) point is established by finding the midpoint between the existing landmarks 22 and 23. This newly defined landmark is positioned precisely at the intersection of the vertical midlines of the face and serves as a reference point for subsequent analyses and measurements in relation to maxillofacial (pertaining to the dental and facial) landmarks. The maxillofacial landmarks and lines derived from the pretrained architecture are as follows:
•	Landmark (N,34) = sN - Sn = soft tissue over Nasion to Subnasale.
•	Landmark (34,9) = Sn-sPog/Gn = Subnasale to soft tissue over Pogonion.
•	Landmark (43,10) = iC line left = inner Canthus line left.
•	Landmark (40,8) = iC line right = inner Canthus line right.
•	Landmark (3,4,….9) = Ar - Go - sPog/Gn right= Articularis to Gonion to soft tissue over Pogonion and Gnathion on the right side.
•	Landmark (9,10,….15) = Ar - Go - sPog/Gn left= Articularis to Gonion to soft tissue over Pogonion and Gnathion on the left side.
•	Landmark (1,17) = sZy left - sZy right = soft tissue over Zygion left to soft tissue over Zygion right.
The distances on the lateral profile measured:
•	Landmark (N,34) = sN - Sn = soft tissue over Nasion to Subnasale.
•	Landmark (34,9) = Sn-sPog/Gn = Subnasale to soft tissue over Pogonion.
•	Landmark (5,9) = Go - Gn/Me = Gonion to Menton
•	Landmakr (2,33) = Ar - Tr = Articulare to Tragus
